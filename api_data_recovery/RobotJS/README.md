# robotJs

This code is a selection of data retrieval javascript code to fetch data from online APIs.
It fetches several data for a range of cities in France from three APIs:

- open weather API (for air quality and air pollution data),

- Pole Emploi API (french employment agency that collects job offers),

- WAQI tile Map (World Air Quality Index API).

This data is saved on a MongoDB non-relational database.
